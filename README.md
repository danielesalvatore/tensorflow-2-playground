# Tensorflow 2.0 Playground

## Notebooks
1. Simple linear regression: minimal example without Tensorflow: manual implementation of a Machine Learning algorithm (loss fn: L2-norm; optimization fn: n-parameter gradient descent)
2. As the fist notebook, but rewrite the algorith using TensorFlow 2.0
3. MNIST dataset, training to recognize hand-written digits
